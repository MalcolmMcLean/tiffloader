# tiffloader
Portable single file ANSI C TIFF file loader

The idea is that this is a one file drop-in TIFF loader.
So there will be no messing about with external dependencies.

It's meant to be totally portable so it won't break anywhere
there's a C compiler.

We need to take a decision on JPEG support, realistically
we'll need to break the single file rule to provide this.
